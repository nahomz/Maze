## Maze

The Maze is a 3D Maze game that uses ray casting to render a 2D map into a 3D navigable world!

The Maze was written was written in C ussing SDL2 library. Deveploment was performed using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - gcc (Ubuntu 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4

### About SDL2 

Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It is used by video playback software, emulators, and popular games including Valve's award winning catalog and many Humble Bundle games.


### To-Do
- Improved map parser
- Better error handling
- More textures
- Enemies / obstacles / objects
- Maze goal that loads next map
- Rain

## Instalation 
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nahomz/Maze.git
```

## How to Compile and Run
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) are required to compile and use this program
- Compile with `gcc 4.8.4` with the following flags:
    ``gcc -O2 -g -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -Isrc/headers *.c -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lm -o maze `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` `` OR `make -f Makefile`
- Run the maze: `./maze` or `./maze maps/<map_name>`
- Disable textures: `./maze no_tex` or `./maze maps/<map_name> no_tex`

### Synopsis
This 3D maze uses raycasting to draw the maze walls, utilizing [LodeV's](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) method of using vectors to calculate ray length. By default the maze uses textures but textures can be disabled on execution.

#### Controls
- `W` : move forward
- `S` : move backward
- `A` : rotate camera left
- `D` : rotate camera right
- `Q` : strafe left
- `E` : strafe right
- `F` : toggle fullscreen
- `ESC` : quit
